[ 2m58s - 3m0s ] Jason Kelce: I'm shaking right now.

[ 3m3s - 3m4s ] Jason Kelce: Did I get everything?
[ 3m4s - 3m12s ] Taylor Swift: That was such an amazing intro and also just like thanks for wearing the merch. That goes a long way.
[ 3m12s - 3m18s ] Taylor Swift: Just like immediately makes me feel comfortable just looking deeply into my own eyes.
[ 3m18s - 3m22s ] Jason Kelce: Okay, all right. That's what I was going for.
[ 3m22s - 3m23s ] Travis Kelce: It's a good t-shirt.
[ 3m23s - 3m25s ] Taylor Swift: Well, thanks for having me. This is my first podcast.
[ 3m25s - 3m28s ] Jason Kelce: This is amazing. Thank you for coming on.
[ 3m28s - 3m33s ] Taylor Swift: I just I was waiting for you guys to invite me. This is my favorite podcast.
[ 3m33s - 3m42s ] Jason Kelce: So we've already been over this. You're a big fan of the show, you're a 92 percenter. What are your favorite segments that you hear Travis and I go into on a routine basis?
[ 3m42s - 4m6s ] Taylor Swift: I like New News just because of the screaming, like I hear him screaming new news from across the house constantly. It's like my favorite part like he'll be like, new news, new news. And I'm in the kitchen be like, new news. Um so I love that because of just the bellowing of it like I love um no dumb questions.
[ 4m6s - 4m11s ] Taylor Swift: I really like it when you give people advice. It's my it's kind of my personal favorite.
[ 4m11s - 4m27s ] Taylor Swift: I mean I think that like you guys give such male-centric advice. It's which which I think is just like just dudes who don't want drama. Dudes who are trying to avoid the mess. Or but sometimes you're going to like do a bit and say the messiest thing that they could do, which is funny too.
[ 4m27s - 4m35s ] Jason Kelce: So, we're going to ask a question everybody watching the show is currently asking. Why are you coming on the show?
[ 4m35s - 4m47s ] Taylor Swift: This podcast has done a lot for me. Um, I owe a lot to this podcast. This podcast got me a boyfriend. Um, ever since Travis decided to use it as his personal dating app about two years ago.
[ 4m47s - 4m50s ] Travis Kelce: It worked pretty good. Yeah. Hey,
[ 4m50s - 4m51s ] Jason Kelce: was his friendship bracelets that good?
[ 4m51s - 4m53s ] Travis Kelce: Yeah, they didn't leave the stadium because I was butt hurt, Jason.
[ 4m53s - 5s14s ] Taylor Swift: He was he threw a tantrum. He threw a man tantrum. It's so funny. It's like old. My plan is ruined. She loves me. She loves me not. She loves me. She loves me not. And she just just wild. She hates me. Like it was such a wild romantic gesture to just be like
[ 5s14s - 5s24s ] Taylor Swift: I want to date you like on. I don't know. It was at first when I looked at it, I was like, this dude is That's what it That's what it does when you're on the stage and you perform in arrow head. That's what it does.
[ 5s24s - 5s35s ] Taylor Swift: This dude didn't get a meet and greet, he's making it everyone's problem. That's what I thought at first and then I was like you come to Arrow head, I get to meet you.
[ 5s35s - 5s40s ] Travis Kelce: That's the perk of playing for the Chiefs. You realize he didn't even reach out to our management.
[ 5s40s - 6s10s ] Taylor Swift: I was like when this podcast came out, I was like, did he ever reach out to be like in the tents or did we know he was in the building? He came with Pat and he thought that cuz he knows the elevator lady that he could talk to her about just getting down to my dressing room. That's how it works. You just go. I got denied. That's how it works in 1973 when the elevator was invented. Yeah, but yeah, but he but he really just was like, I know a guy.
[ 6s10s - 6s30s ] Taylor Swift: I can figure this out. But um I actually when I thought about it, I was like, actually we live in a day and age where like I'm not a very I'm not an online person at all. I'm not like on social media like that. and like I'm genuinely terrified to open my DMs. It's just like it's just like there's smoke coming out of my DM.
[ 6s30s - 6s31s ] Travis Kelce: Are you not entertained?
[ 6s31s - 6s32s ] Jason Kelce: No.
[ 6s32s - 6s44s ] Taylor Swift: So this kind of felt more like I was in an 80s John Hughes movie and he was just like standing outside of my window with a boom box just being like, I want to date you.
[ 6s44s - 6s45s ] Travis Kelce: Yeah.
[ 6s45s - 6s50s ] Taylor Swift: Do you want to go on a date with me? I made you a friendship brace, so do you want to date me?
[ 6s50s - 6s52s ] Travis Kelce: Just come outside and meet me. Just meet me once.
[ 6s52s - 7s11s ] Taylor Swift: Give me a chance. So if this guy isn't crazy which is a big if this is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager.
[ 7s11s - 7s13s ] Jason Kelce: I I feel that.
[ 7s13s - 7s16s ] Taylor Swift: And I was sitting there at the tour listening to every single one of the songs like she, I know she wants me to do this.
[ 7s16s - 7s18s ] Travis Kelce: We have one IP address from one iPhone that continuously has listened to these songs.
[ 7s18s - 7s20s ] Taylor Swift: It's fantastic. Thank you so much.
[ 7s20s - 7s28s ] Jason Kelce: Did you have a favorite album that you re-recorded that like, are there different eras that you liked recording more rerecording.
[ 7s28s - 7s34s ] Travis Kelce: I will say this, there's a few good playlists out there that have a mixture of them all. You've been streaming?
[ 7s34s - 7s44s ] Taylor Swift: I really liked them all, but I think Red was very special. There were songs that I called from the vault songs. And there was one which I think is maybe my favorite song I've ever written called all too well the 10-minute version where I unearthed
[ 7s44s - 7s51s ] Taylor Swift: there were there were originally so many more verses in that song than ended up being on the on the album that I had put out when I originally put out Red.
[ 7s51s - 7s58s ] Taylor Swift: I made the um the glorious fortuitous mistake of saying that to my fans in an interview.
[ 7s58s - 8s2s ] Jason Kelce: You know what those words mean. you're so handsome.
[ 8s2s - 8s6s ] Taylor Swift: So um basically uh I
[ 8s6s - 8s14s ] Taylor Swift: said that in an interview to my fans and they just like hung on to it. They were like where's the 10-minute version? Give us the 10-minute version. Yeah. And
[ 8s14s - 8s24s ] Taylor Swift: when it came time to doing Taylor's version and re-recording the album, I went back in, found the verses, um restructured the song to the way that it pretty much was when I had originally written it.
[ 8s24s - 8s31s ] Taylor Swift: Put them back in. And that song is one of my favorite things I've ever done and it was on the tour
[ 8s31s - 8s34s ] Jason Kelce: You want to know what's iconic part of your your that tour.
[ 8s34s - 8s44s ] Taylor Swift: It it was so fun and so like yeah, it really did make me fall back in love with that album specifically. I have a song with Phoebe Bridgers that I really love on that from the vault.
[ 8s44s - 8s50s ] Taylor Swift: Chris Stapleton was a part of it as well. And I just I think that one
[ 8s50s - 9s12s ] Taylor Swift: I've always loved Fearless in 1989 in a very pure way, but Red I've kind of gone back and forth over the years and been like, you know, like that re-recording it made me just be like, ah, God, I love that album. I have no no complicated feelings about it.
[ 9s12s - 9s20s ] Taylor Swift: I wouldn't have done anything different. Maybe except include the original versus the first time. Well, you you told a story with the second time you released this album, right? And the fans got behind that narrative and they're like
[ 9s20s - 9s24s ] Travis Kelce: And by the way Screw the first album. We're we're rolling with the re-recorded album because we're supporting the artists.
[ 9s24s - 9s28s ] Taylor Swift: Yeah They were like we ride at dawn. Like and it was an it was amazing because
[ 9s28s - 9s51s ] Taylor Swift: they're the reason why the re records worked out. They're the reason I was able to purchase my music back because they came to the A tour. Um and basically they're the reason why any of this worked out and I also want to note that like the other people who are like we ride at dawn
[ 9s51s - 10s7s ] Taylor Swift: my live band they played on all the re records. It's like you want to know why they sound so perfect on the A tour. They played on all those records. Like they're session musicians too.
[ 10s7s - 10s17s ] Taylor Swift: And that's how good they are. And I'm I'm so impressed just by their ability and their dexterity as musicians to be able to do that.
[ 10s17s - 10s20s ] Travis Kelce: So, how does music ownership, this is so crazy to me.
[ 10s20s - 10s23s ] Taylor Swift: So there's two main categories that we're talking about here.
[ 10s23s - 10s33s ] Taylor Swift: So, master recordings is the actual recording. It's the actual vocal band production, mixing, mastering, that actual thing.
[ 10s33s - 10s36s ] Jason Kelce: Mine also included my album artwork, my music videos,
[ 10s36s - 10s45s ] Taylor Swift: everything that went along with any era of music that I had done for my first six albums. And so.
[ 10s45s - 10s50s ] Taylor Swift: Then there's also the then there's another category which is publishing. I own my publishing.
[ 10s50s - 11s15s ] Taylor Swift: Which is why, you know, I have control over you know, if my song is used in a film and and I wanted them to use Taylor's version instead of the original version, I the songwriter can decide that. Yeah. So and it's like I basically I I've always been very lucky because my publishing was protected.
[ 11s15s - 11s32s ] Jason Kelce: You being the song writer, being the singer, owning no publishing rights, being able to re-record songs, that gave you leverage and able to make this move, right?
[ 11s32s - 11s34s ] Taylor Swift: Yes. Yeah.
[ 11s34s - 11s35s ] Jason Kelce: Yes.
[ 11s35s - 11s51s ] Travis Kelce: So and also in my contract, they didn't put a clause in that said I couldn't re-record because nobody was doing it and nobody thought that was a good idea. Right. And also like who would be that stubborn? Like who would be
[ 11s1s - 11s56s ] Taylor Swift: that petty that they would record every single thing all over again.
[ 11s2s - 11s58s ] Travis Kelce: It's so bad ass get over here. What was your favorite one to re record.
[ 11s8s - 12s0s ] Jason Kelce: No not just that. Hold on though, not just that.
[ 12s0s - 12s4s ] Jason Kelce: Who has a fan base that's going to listen to the same album twice in a row? It's a good point Jason. It's an a good point. You know what it is?
[ 12s4s - 12s9s ] Jason Kelce: you had this die hard community that you already built.
[ 12s9s - 12s24s ] Taylor Swift: The fans, you ride it Dawn. They're the reason why any of this has happened, and also I want to note that like the other people who are like, we ride at dawn. My live band, they played on all the records. Like you want to know why they sound so perfect on the tour. They played on all those records. Like they're session musicians too.
[ 12s4s - 12s25s ] Travis Kelce: You told a story with the second time you released this album, right? And the fans got behind that narrative. And I was on the A's tour.
[ 12s5s - 12s44s ] Taylor Swift: I'm watching people just like cathartically scream this song to the point where I'm like, do you need do you need to go to the hospital? Like, it was so passionate the fan response to that song at the A tour and I remember thinking so many times like, what if this never happened? Like, what if I never had the record. it's one of the most iconic parts of your of that tour. It it was so fun and so like yeah, it really did make me fall back in love with that album specifically.
[ 12s4s - 12s47s ] Jason Kelce: And they're like screw the first album. We're rolling with the re-recorded album because we're supporting the artist, right?
[ 12s7s - 13s8s ] Taylor Swift: I have a song with Phoebe Bridgers that I really love on that from the vault. Chris Stapleton was a part of it as well. And I just, I think that one, I've always loved Fearless in 1989 in a very pure way, but Red, I've kind of gone back and forth over the years and been like, you know, like that re-recording it made me just be like, ah, God, I love that album. I have no no complicated feelings about it. I wouldn't have done anything different. Maybe except I would have include the original verses the first time.
[ 13s8s - 13s30s ] Taylor Swift: Basically, then you have the the master recordings side of things. Now, this is a discussion that was not really brought up among the artist communities, especially not with fans. This was all kind of industry-centric and kind of boring contract stuff that like fans were not speaking about.
[ 13s0s - 13s32s ] Jason Kelce: So how how does ownership of music even work? Like when you recorded these songs when you were 16, right? Is that like the singer gets a certain portion, the the artist gets or the songwriter gets a certain portion and then the publishing company gets a certain portion?
[ 13s2s - 13s41s ] Travis Kelce: Can you dump it down to us? 99%. you're so good. I didn't even know what you just asked. Go ahead. The greatest songwriter of all time. Says her boyfriend. Yes. Yeah, it's a huge thing.
[ 13s1s - 13s43s ] Taylor Swift: and so one thing that I think is really great that has come about because of this is that I have so many new artists come up to me now and say, hey, I didn't even know this was a thing. And when I went to go and negotiate for my record deal, I negotiated to have my masters revert back to me after a certain amount of years.
[ 13s3s - 13s48s ] Jason Kelce: Oh, wow. Yeah. or that I own them outright.
[ 13s8s - 13s58s ] Taylor Swift: And it's not for everyone. Not everyone cares about this. Artist to artist, artists have different priorities. Some artists sell off all their masters because everyone's allowed to have their own priorities. What I wanted though is that
[ 13s8s - 14s2s ] Jason Kelce: You're more aware than I think probably most artists are. That's crazy.
[ 14s2s - 14s18s ] Taylor Swift: if I were to put the information out about what I went through, at least it gets artists talking about this to decide whether this is a priority for them because you can't know if it's a priority for you unless you know what has come before you and what has happened and so that's why
[ 14s8s - 14s20s ] Travis Kelce: I know who she is. You know what I'm saying. I'm telling you. And this is where they missed it.
[ 14s0s - 14s23s ] Jason Kelce: She's a smart woman in the world. Says her boyfriend, smartest woman in the world. you're making this die hard community that you already built.
[ 14s3s - 14s24s ] Travis Kelce: I listen to the I'll listen to the fear of 1989 I'll listen to that one too.
[ 14s4s - 14s31s ] Taylor Swift: I had to re record my music. I didn't have to re record the music videos and everything. I do love every era, but I definitely feel a special connection to what it's about and the memories and the fans being as crazy as they are.
[ 14s1s - 14s36s ] Jason Kelce: Do you think it was easier for you to do one because you're I mean, just you talking about this, you're so aware of the business side of this in the legal ramifications.
[ 14s6s - 14s49s ] Taylor Swift: But I'm going to have so many more re records. I'm going to be doing one more re record and I really enjoyed every single second of making all of these re records. But I will say that the original songs I put on the re records, like the from the Vault songs, the songs I didn't get on the album, those are my favorites because it's like a time capsule of like these songs that I was so attached to and so obsessed with and so excited about.
[ 14s9s - 15s6s ] Taylor Swift: But my record label was like, no, this is not a hit. We're not putting this on the album. And like, sometimes that's right. Sometimes that's wrong. You know? And it's so much fun to just like give people like the the full picture, the full story of what it was like to make these albums and what the original track list was supposed to be before people had opinions.
[ 15s6s - 15s32s ] Taylor Swift: It's like I have the original track list of all of the songs from all of the albums and then I have a whole bunch of extra songs that I wrote and loved and adored and had a whole plan for and then the record label was like, let's take these three off and put these other three on. And so I'm like, oh my god, they're like my children. You're like, which one am I gonna choose? And so it's just really cool to be able to kind of give the fans the whole story.
[ 15s2s - 15s33s ] Jason Kelce: So you're saying every album that you've ever done had other songs that you thought about putting on there? Yeah. So you have a vault of songs that you just are like, this is the first time you've released them?
[ 15s3s - 15s52s ] Taylor Swift: Yes, and I had like 50 songs for Fearless and I had like 40 songs for Speak Now and I had like 30 something songs for Red and like I just have to like pick 13 to 15. And it's like and these were songs that I like I I adored these songs and I had to make these really difficult choices and so it was such a like a glorious thing to be able to put those songs out.
[ 15s2s - 15s55s ] Travis Kelce: I thought that was one of the coolest things about the records. It wasn't just the fact that it was yours, it was the fact that you threw on some like, like Jason just said, some vaulted songs that you just couldn't put on there, I think the first time. I mean I don't know the exact story.
[ 15s5s - 16s3s ] Taylor Swift: Every single one of them has at least eight vault songs. And so I think like I was thinking that was really cool. And like what a fun thing for the fans to look forward to of like I get to hear these songs for the first time.
[ 16s3s - 16s16s ] Taylor Swift: It's kind of like I get to have like a new album release with an old album at the same time. And I think that's why they did so well. I think that's why they were so exciting because like the fans were like, oh my gosh, I get to listen to this album again, but also I get to hear these new songs.
[ 16s6s - 16s21s ] Travis Kelce: So you got the original and then you get that vault and then you get Taylor's version which is just better produced. Like the production on it's just unreal. I don't know the I don't know the exact but it's just cleaner. It's just a it's a better feel to the to the actual like the sound of it, the music itself.
[ 16s1s - 16s32s ] Jason Kelce: I didn't know there were new songs on there. I'm such an idiot. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I feel bad now. Like a die hard 92%. I'm supposed to know these things. My god. How how dare I not know that there are new songs on there?
[ 16s2s - 16s45s ] Taylor Swift: Jason, they are called from the vault songs. And they are literally the best thing ever. I love them so much. I love the fact that like I can release them now. They have such special like features on them. I have a feature with Florence and the Machine on the new on the Speak Now re record. And I have Chris Stapleton, I have Phoebe Bridgers, I have all these artists that like are my friends and are amazing.
[ 16s5s - 16s51s ] Jason Kelce: Do you ask these guys if they're like, hey, I got these songs I've had in the vault. Do you want to do a song together?
[ 16s1s - 17s8s ] Taylor Swift: So I will like I I will call them and I'll be like, hey, I'm re recording this album and I think you would be amazing on this song. And like, so then they'll come in and they'll record and like it's just it's just such a cool process to revisit these albums.
[ 17s8s - 17s15s ] Taylor Swift: but it's also like a little bit of a time machine because you're going back to when you were 16 and you're like, oh my god, I was so dramatic. And then you're going back to when you're 18 and you're like, oh my god, I was so dramatic.
[ 17s5s - 17s23s ] Jason Kelce: And what do you think of Travis when he does the do you look back at that and be like, oh, he's so dramatic? When he's doing the, like, he's on the ground. Like, oh my God. Oh my God. He's so dramatic.
[ 17s3s - 17s40s ] Taylor Swift: I just think it's funny. I think that he is such a such a like a character. I mean, he is, you've seen him. He is such a character. And I think that it's so funny to watch him get all fired up and I'm like, oh my god. Like, that's my boyfriend. I'm so proud of him. And like, he is just so passionate about what he does and I think it's so cool. I love it.
[ 17s0s - 17s47s ] Travis Kelce: I mean I'm just trying to get some some calls thrown my way. I mean sometimes you just got to flop. I mean that's the nature of the game. You're not trying to flop. I mean you are trying to flop. You're trying to sell it a little bit but it's like hey you got to try and do something to get the to get the ref to throw a flag. I mean it's football.
[ 17s7s - 18s3s ] Taylor Swift: it's not, I don't know, it's just funny to watch you get all fired up and I'm like, oh my God, like, that's my boyfriend. I'm so proud of him. And like, he is just so passionate about what he does and I think it's so cool. I love it. It's funny because I think that like, I've had to explain to so many of my friends like what is happening and why is he screaming and what does that mean and what are the stakes and everything. And it's like I've learned so much about football.
[ 17s7s - 18s6s ] Jason Kelce: Yeah. Has this been weird to go into this, this world of football? Cause I mean, I would assume you've, maybe you were into it before, I don't know, but to, to go into this whole world, and now you have like, I don't know, half the league's fans, like, following you, and like, you have all these like, what is, what has that been like?
[ 18s6s - 18s30s ] Taylor Swift: It's been wild. I mean, it's been so much fun. I've had such a blast. I mean, I have been, I have gone to more football games this season than I have in my entire life. And I have loved every second of it. I love the fact that it is a community. I love the fact that it is, it's like, it's such a sport. It's so strategic. And it's so like, it's so fun to watch. And I've gotten to learn so much about it.
[ 18s0s - 18s33s ] Travis Kelce: And she's a smart one. So she's learning fast. I mean, I tell her, I'm like, hey, that's a, that's a cover too. She's like, I know what a cover too is. I'm like, all right. I'm like, hey, we're in a, we're in a goal line situation. She's like, I know we're in a goal line situation. I'm like, all right. I mean, you get it.
[ 18s3s - 18s50s ] Jason Kelce: Well, that's good. I'm glad that you're enjoying it. I'm glad that you're, you know, coming out and supporting Travis. I mean, it's been, it's been fun for, for me, for Kylie, for our family to get to know you. And, you know, we, we've had a blast. We've, we've had so much fun with you. And it's, it's been, it's been really cool. It's been a fun ride. And, you know, we, we, we wish you guys the best of luck. And, you know, we, we love you guys. And we're, we're excited to see where it goes.
[ 18s0s - 18s51s ] Taylor Swift: Aw, thank you guys. I mean, it's been so much fun to get to know you guys. I mean, I've had so much fun. I've gotten to hang out with your girls. I've gotten to hang out with Kylie. I've gotten to hang out with you, Jason. I've gotten to hang out with Donna. And it's been so much fun. And I've loved it so much. And it's been so much fun to get to know your whole family.
[ 18s1s - 19s24s ] Jason Kelce: Well, and then on top of that, you know, we have, we have a little something for you because, you know, we, we were thinking about what we could possibly get you that you don't already have. And we know that you're a big collector. We know that you love collecting things. And so, we, we have a couple of things for you. We have a, a New Heights vinyl. And we have a New Heights Super Bowl ring. So, we, we have, we have a couple of things for you to add to your collection. And, you know, we, we hope you enjoy them. And we hope that, you know, you'll, you'll think of us when you, when you look at them. And, you know, we, we love you. We're so happy for you guys. And we're excited to see where it goes.
[ 19s4s - 19s26s ] Taylor Swift: Oh my god, you guys. Oh my god. This is the sweetest thing. Oh my god. I'm going to cry. Oh my god. This is so sweet. I love this so much. Thank you guys so much. This is so sweet. I love this. I'm going to put this right next to my Grammy's. This is so cool. I love this so much. Thank you guys. This is so sweet.
[ 19s6s - 19s40s ] Travis Kelce: We had to do something special for you because, you know, you're, you're a special person. And we, we love you. And we're so happy for you guys. And we're excited to see where it goes. And, you know, we're, we're just, we're just so happy for you. We're so happy for you. And we love you so much. And we're just so excited for you guys. And we're just so happy. 


[20:00] Travis Kelce, I think doing it the right way,
[20:02] Travis Kelce, creating the fan base that you did, the right way, and um, and and leading your life in a in a direction that you you were eventually going to get it back somehow, some way because of you um always doing things uh with the right intentions.
[20:15] Travis Kelce, So,
[20:15] Taylor Swift, Thanks.
[20:17] Jason Kelce, So, how I guess how does music ownership This is so crazy to me. So you wrote these songs, you sang these songs, you put everything into them and don't get me wrong. There's publishing companies, people that support artists out there, but how how does ownership of music even work? Like when you recorded these songs when you were 16, right? Is that like
[20:37] Jason Kelce, You're the singer
[20:37] Travis Kelce, Can you dumb it down to us 99 percenters.
[20:40] Jason Kelce, Yeah the singer gets a certain portion, the the uh the artist gets a or the songwriter gets a certain portion and then the publishing company gets a certain portion or
[20:49] Taylor Swift, Okay, so this is that's a great question and there's two main categories that we're talking about here.
[20:53] Travis Kelce, so good at this. I don't even know what you just asked. go ahead.
[20:55] Taylor Swift, So, master recordings is the actual um recording.
[21:00] Jason Kelce, Yes.
[21:00] Taylor Swift, It's the actual vocal, band, production, mixing, mastering, that actual thing.
[21:06] Jason Kelce, Yes.
[21:07] Taylor Swift, Um, mine mine also included my album artwork, my music videos, um, everything that went along with any era of music that I had done for my first six albums.
[21:17] Travis Kelce, Got it. every era.
[21:19] Taylor Swift, So then there's also then there's another category, which is publishing.
[21:24] Jason Kelce, Yes.
[21:24] Taylor Swift, I own my publishing. which is why you know, I have control over you know, if my song is used in a film and I and and I wanted them to use Taylor's version instead of the original version, I the songwriter can decide that.
[21:40] Jason Kelce, Got it. Okay.
[21:41] Taylor Swift, you know? And so it's like I basically I I've always been very lucky because my publishing was protected. A lot of artists have have their publishing sold away from them or they sell their publishing and I, you know, and a lot of artists, it may not be important to them. It was always important for me. The publishing aspect of it has always been something I've had firmly in place, which is great because my songwriting is the core of of why I do this, why I love it so much, and what I think has made anything happen in my career at all.
[22:13] Travis Kelce, Greatest songwriter of all time.
[22:14] Taylor Swift, That's very nice of you to say that.
[22:16] Jason Kelce, It's like says her boyfriend.
[22:18] Taylor Swift, Um
[22:18] Jason Kelce, Says a lot of people.
[22:20] Taylor Swift, basically, then you have the the master recording side of things. Now, this is a discussion that was not really brought up amongst the artist communities, especially not with fans. This was all kind of industry-centric and kind of boring contract stuff that like fans were not speaking about.
[22:42] Taylor Swift, And so one thing that I think is really great that has come about because of this is that I have so many new artists come up to me now and say, hey, I didn't even know this was a thing. And when I went to go and negotiate for my record deal, I negotiated to have my masters revert back to me after a certain amount of years, or that I own them outright. And it's not for everyone. Not everyone cares about this. Artist to artist, artists have different priorities. Some artists sell off all their masters because everyone's allowed to have their own priorities. What I wanted though is that if I were to put the information out about what I went through, at least it gets artists talking about this to decide whether this is a priority for them because you can't know if it's a priority for you unless you know what has come before you and what has happened. And so the master recordings thing, that's your actual ownership of your recordings. To put it in perspective, if I never would have been able to buy back my music, one day, someone else would be leaving all of my music from my first six albums to their kids in their will.
[23:50] Jason Kelce, Right. Yes.
[23:52] Taylor Swift, And you think about it like that, it's like, I thought of it, I made it, I recorded it. I paid for most of those music videos. You know, I wanted an opportunity to to buy that back. and that was important to me.
[24:02] Jason Kelce, you feel like they're yours. They should be yours.
[24:04] Taylor Swift, Yeah, exactly.
[24:06] Jason Kelce, Do you think it was easier for you to do, one because you're I mean, just you talking about this, you're so aware of the business side of this and the legal like you're more aware than I think probably most artists are,
[24:18] Travis Kelce, but being a s she's the smartest woman in the world. It's crazy.
[24:20] Taylor Swift, that says her boyfriend. says her boyfriend.
[24:22] Travis Kelce, smartest woman in the world.
[24:24] Jason Kelce, You being the songwriter, being the singer, owning no publishing rights, being able to re-record songs, that gave you leverage and able to make this move, right?
[24:35] Taylor Swift, Yes. Yes.
[24:37] Jason Kelce, Yeah.
[24:37] Taylor Swift, Yes. So that was and also uh, you know, in my contract they didn't put a clause in that said I couldn't re-record because nobody was doing it and nobody thought that was a good idea.
[24:48] Jason Kelce, right.
[24:49] Taylor Swift, and also like who would be that stubborn? Like who would be
[24:54] Jason Kelce, who would be that petty.
[24:57] Travis Kelce, this badass kid over here.
[24:58] Taylor Swift, that they would record every single thing all over again. It's so badass.
[25:02] Jason Kelce, What was your favorite one?
[25:02] Travis Kelce, I don't know. What was your favorite one?
[25:03] Jason Kelce, Not just not just that, hold on though. Not just that, who has a fan base that's going to listen to the same album twice in a row.
[25:09] Taylor Swift, It's a good point Jason.
[25:10] Jason Kelce, Like honestly you
[25:12] Travis Kelce, You and you had to diehard community that you had already built. I'll listen to that one too.
[25:18] Jason Kelce, You told a story with the second time you released this album, right? And the fans got behind that narrative and they're like, "screw the first album. We're rolling, we're rolling with the re-recorded album because we support the artist."
[25:31] Taylor Swift, and the fans. They were like, we ride at dawn. Like and it was it was amazing because you know they're the reason why the re-records worked out. They're the reason I was able to purchase my music back because they came to the eras tour. Um, and basically they're the reason why any of this worked out. And I also want to note that like the other people who are like "we ride at dawn." My, my live band, they played on all the re-records.
[25:58] Jason Kelce, Yeah.
[25:58] Taylor Swift, It's like, you wanna know why they sound so perfect on the eras tour? They played, they played on all those records. Like they're session musicians too.
[26:08] Taylor Swift, and that's how good they are and I'm I'm so impressed just by their ability and their dexterity as musicians to be able to do that uh so convincingly because they're there are actually some they're the Taylor's versions I kind of prefer a lot of that stuff. I think it sounds incredible.
[26:26] Taylor Swift, but I'm happy to have all of it.
[26:28] Jason Kelce, So that leads me to the next question. Okay. Now that you own all of it, you have the re-recordings, you have the original recordings, what should we listen to? Like what, do I, do I roll with the, Does it matter? You're just like, whatever you guys want, like
[26:42] Taylor Swift, yeah it's your choice. It's it's really whatever you guys want because I love both of them. I would not have put out the re-records if I didn't think that they held up or were better. I think a lot of the vocals I did on the re-records are better than the originals.
[26:54] Travis Kelce, ooh
[26:55] Taylor Swift, But it's like if you found a nostalgia in the originals and that was what you were listening to when you were 12 years old bopping around in your bedroom, go crazy.
[27:03] Travis Kelce, Yeah. we got 'em all.
[27:05] Jason Kelce, I'm going to start doing comparisons. That's what I gotta do. I just got to start doing comparisons.
[27:09] Taylor Swift, Yeah, you're going to listen to every beat. You're certainly, it's not mandatory Jason.
[27:13] Jason Kelce, I mean it sounds like a good time.
[27:14] Travis Kelce, I'll say this, there's a few good uh playlists out there that have a mixture of them all.
[27:17] Taylor Swift, You've been streaming?
[27:18] Travis Kelce, Yes.
[27:18] Taylor Swift, Thank you. I've been streaming for about two years now.
[27:21] Travis Kelce, Oh
[27:22] Taylor Swift, Just that's fantastic. Thank you so much. That's why we got that spike in in the 35 year old male demographic.
[27:30] Travis Kelce, Yes. That 1.7 billion, that was at least one billion of it. I'm sure for sure.
[27:34] Jason Kelce, We have one IP address from one iPhone that continually is listening to this playlist.
[27:39] Jason Kelce, Did you have a favorite album that you re-recorded that like, are there different eras that you liked recording more, re-recording?
[27:48] Taylor Swift, I really liked them all but I think Red was very special. There were songs that I called "From the Vault" songs and there was one which I think is maybe my favorite song I've ever written called "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" where I unearthed there were there were originally so many more verses in that song than ended up being on the on the album that I had put out when I originally put out Red. I made the um, the glorious fortuitous mistake of saying that to my fans in an interview.
[28:21] Travis Kelce, You know what those words mean.
[28:22] Taylor Swift, I love it. You're so handsome.
[28:25] Taylor Swift, So um basically, uh, I said that in an interview to my fans and they just like hung onto it. They were like, "where's the 10 minute version? Give us the 10 minute version."
[28:38] Jason Kelce, Yeah.
[28:39] Taylor Swift, and um when it came time to doing Taylor's version and re-recording the album, I went back in, found the verses, um, re-structured the song to the way that it pretty much was when I had originally written it, put them back in. And that song is one of my favorite things I've ever done. And it was when we're on the Eras tour, I'm watching people just like cathartically scream this song to the point where I'm like "Do you need, do you need to go to the hospital?" Like, it was so passionate. The fan response to that song at the Eras tour and I remember thinking so many times like "What if this never happened?"
[29:16] Taylor Swift, Like what if I never had the re-records
[29:19] Travis Kelce, It's one of the most iconic parts of your of that tour.
[29:22] Taylor Swift, it was so fun and so like yeah, it really did make me fall back in love with that album specifically. I have a song with Phoebe Bridgers that I really love on that, you know, from the vault, Chris Stapleton was a part of it as well. and I just I think that one, I've always loved Fearless in 1989 in a very pure way, but Red I've kind of gone back and forth over the years and been like, you know, like that re-recording it made me just be like "Oh, God I love that album. I have no, no complicated feelings about that. I wouldn't have done anything different."
[29:56] Jason Kelce, maybe except to include the original verses the first time.
[29:59] Taylor Swift, Well,
[30:00] Jason Kelce, Well, let's, we've just talked about the different eras a little bit. Let's talk about perhaps the most daunting thing that any artist has ever taken on, which is the Eras tour.
[30:09] Taylor Swift, Oh my god.
[30:10] Jason Kelce, Um, you finally finished it up last December in Vancouver. Uh, I don't know, what did it feel like to wrap it up? What does it feel like now, like not touring and being on a jet every day basically trying to go from country to country?
[30:26] Jason Kelce, yeah.
[30:26] Travis Kelce, it's insane.
[30:28] Taylor Swift, I mean it feels, it feels great Jason, to be honest. Um, I'm not gonna lie to you.
[30:33] Jason Kelce, You don't miss it?
[30:34] Taylor Swift, I I miss it. Um, I do miss it but it's like it was perfect for what it was.
[30:40] Travis Kelce, Yeah. Do you know what I mean?
[30:41] Taylor Swift, and it was a lot of
[30:43] Taylor Swift, it was a lot of physical therapy and it was a lot of like being in a state of perpetual physical discomfort.
[30:51] Travis Kelce, I see,
[30:52] Taylor Swift, kind of like when you're in season.
[30:54] Travis Kelce, you know? Yeah. no. I understand.
[30:55] Taylor Swift, I'm not getting hit
[30:57] Travis Kelce, My first time after
[30:57] Taylor Swift, by huge 300 pounders but
[31:01] Taylor Swift, the heels. The heels. No, when I saw the recovery station in the hotel room after with the toe spacers and
[31:07] Taylor Swift, I've got an acupuncture mat. I've got
[31:10] Travis Kelce, See, I'm telling you dude, the similarities were crazy. I'm like "Oh my gosh. She goes more than I do."
[31:16] Taylor Swift, We're like comparing physical therapy stories, like recovery stuff.
[31:18] Jason Kelce, But, have you ever tried taping your ankles?
[31:21] Travis Kelce, the ankle tape guy.
[31:23] Taylor Swift, I haven't. Yeah, I I miss it because I miss the fans and I miss that connection.
[31:29] Travis Kelce, I miss the football crew.
[31:29] Taylor Swift, but at the same time it was so special. It was like the most formative time of my life. Um, I learned so much about about how far I can push myself and if I set a goal, you know, making that a three and a half hour show in the beginning of the tour. it's like you can't like be sick one day and then decide tonight is gonna be two and a half hours.
[31:51] Jason Kelce, Right.
[31:51] Taylor Swift, And it's really just like prioritizing the fan's experience before, before anything else and my fellow performers.
[31:58] Travis Kelce, Do with a broken heart.
[31:59] Jason Kelce, Don't get me started.
[32:00] Taylor Swift, or like stomach flu or like just like aching feet or blisters or whatever. Like it just it just was
[32:08] Travis Kelce, Which she had all of this going through usually all at the same time.
[32:14] Jason Kelce, going into her fourth show.
[32:16] Taylor Swift, And it's just, it it was kind of the coolest thing in the world because when we were putting together this tour, I had some really lofty goals I wanted to reach conceptually because I wanted to show, I wanted to show fans and especially younger fans, visuals and sort of performance art references that were really important to me as a kid and what inspired me to want to do this right? So like I wanted to put elements of of musical theater, Broadway, ballet, you know, scenery that you would see in an opera, uh, kind of
[32:55] Travis Kelce, She thinks like this.
[32:56] Jason Kelce, I was about to say I watched the whole tour. I don't I just thought it was amazing. I didn't notice this.
[33:01] Taylor Swift, but that's, that's exactly it. I wanted it to be references that I thought were really high concept and really high value for fans and for them to see things they hadn't necessarily seen before all in one concert. but I wanted to do it at, at the highest intensity, rapid fire, you're seeing something new every 15 to 30 seconds and so it feels like you're scrolling in an algorithm, right?
[33:25] Travis Kelce, Yeah.
[33:25] Taylor Swift, And when I heard reports of people saying that they got actual amnesia after the concerts, I was like,
[33:34] Jason Kelce, I think we did it.
[33:35] Travis Kelce, you nailed it.
[33:36] Taylor Swift, Yeah, I think, I think we did it. nailed it. That's, that's genuinely, like that that's, I didn't even, wasn't even shooting for that goal. When they're like, I saw so many things and I experienced a state of euphoria that I now don't remember what happened to me. I was like, oh my god.
[33:52] Travis Kelce, All I remember is that she didn't want to meet me. That's it. That's all he got about it.
[33:58] Travis Kelce, And as much as much, as you and I've told you this as much as you want to you know give new heights credit. I give the eras tour credit.
[34:05] Taylor Swift, Yeah?
[34:06] Travis Kelce, I give the eras tour credit because if I would have never gone to that show and been mesmerized and just been captivated,
[34:12] Jason Kelce, Yeah.
[34:12] Travis Kelce, and then left with such a desire to want to meet you.
[34:18] Taylor Swift, Aw.
[34:18] Travis Kelce, I would have never uh went on here and told everybody how butthurt I was.
[34:22] Travis Kelce, Yeah, I've never just been so engulfed in the curiosity of who you were.
[34:27] Taylor Swift, Oh, that's so sweet. Look at this.
[34:28] Jason Kelce, I really, you know what the best thing about that last statement is you didn't even know what the word engulfed meant before like you met Taylor. Like this is you've broadened your horizons so much.
[34:37] Travis Kelce, it's, we're the perfect team. I'm telling you. It's so, she makes me so much better.
[34:40] Jason Kelce, There's no question.
[34:41] Taylor Swift, Thank you for saying that. Thank you for saying that.
[34:46] Jason Kelce, Um.
[34:48] Travis Kelce, And then but it's like you see you on the stage and you see how crazy you can get an entire stadium going and then I get you in a room and it's like I've known you forever. It's like it was just the easiest conversation I ever had and it was just so much fun that it just uh it uh knocked my socks off from what they say.
[35:09] Jason Kelce, Knocked your socks off? Yeah.
[35:10] Travis Kelce, Yeah.
[35:11] Taylor Swift, Thank you. I felt the same when I met you.
[35:12] Travis Kelce, She blew me away. I I I had never I had never experienced something so mesmerizing on stage and then so real and so beautiful in person.
[35:22] Taylor Swift, Hey. That's wonderful. Should I, should I leave? I'm just gonna
[35:26] Taylor Swift, Yeah, I think so. Honestly, at this point, I think everyone should leave.
[35:31] Jason Kelce, I don't know where to go from here now. Uh what, how many countries did you do the eras tour in?
[35:36] Taylor Swift, Um
[35:38] Taylor Swift, 47,000 countries Jason.
[35:42] Travis Kelce, You just listed that in the beginning.
[35:44] Jason Kelce, I said 51 cities, which I don't know if that's right.
[35:48] Taylor Swift, It was a lot of countries. What was really fun about all the countries that we went to um is when we first started dating he was like, I always wanted to go and really vacation in Europe and see Australia and you know go to Asia and the I was like well
[36:06] Taylor Swift, I got, I got a tour for that, you know? It's coming up.
[36:10] Travis Kelce, yo nice. you got room for a 6'5 guy to
[36:13] Taylor Swift, Yeah, we can figure it out.
[36:13] Travis Kelce, come hang out.
[36:14] Taylor Swift, like no. That's a, the dimensions are wild but we'll make some room. I think we'll have to leave some, some equipment trunks behind.
[36:23] Travis Kelce, Thank you for accommodating. the size
[36:25] Taylor Swift, but, but absolutely we'd be happy to have you. And we got to, you know, we got to travel the world and have vacations and adventures when I wasn't on stage which was really fun because
[36:35] Jason Kelce, Yeah.
[36:35] Taylor Swift, like Europe was so fun. Australia is amazing.
[36:38] Jason Kelce, Yeah.
[36:39] Taylor Swift, um, yeah it was great and and that entire part of our lives, like, I was on tour for so long and now I finally am not on tour and it's it's kind of great because I'm getting my hobbies back. Like when I was on tour all I had the bandwidth for was what are the acoustic mashups this week? What, how do I say welcome to the Eras tour in Portuguese? You know, that was the only thing taking up my brain space and now it's uh
[37:10] Travis Kelce, It's been so fun to see what Taylor actually gets into around the house.
[37:17] Taylor Swift, It's like I'd say all my hobbies could be categorized as like hobbies you could have had in the 1700s.
[37:25] Jason Kelce, You know, like I get on my granny shit.
[37:27] Jason Kelce, you enjoy doing all of these homie things. Is that basically what you're saying?
[37:30] Taylor Swift, Yeah. I like to sew.
[37:33] Jason Kelce, Yes.
[37:34] Taylor Swift, I specialize as you know in children's purses and baby blankets. I make two things and that's it.
[37:40] Travis Kelce, You do know that very well. very good at these two things.
[37:42] Taylor Swift, Um I love to paint. I love to cook. I have a different baking obsession every 6 months.
[37:51] Travis Kelce, I'm the luckiest man in the world. right now. I'm deep in a sourdough obsession that has taken over my life.
[37:58] Jason Kelce, I am aware. Oh I am aware, and I am very deep in it now. You've gotten me deep in this.
[38:04] Travis Kelce, I'm lucky, I'm lucky I'm I'm working as as much as I am, I'm running as much as I am because I am I'm getting the caloric intake. I'm carbing up.
[38:11] Taylor Swift, Yeah, he he asked me to send him two loaves of sourdough at training camp. I'm like I'm like wrapping sourdough loaves in like, like saran wrap or whatever like like cling film.
[38:23] Taylor Swift, The sourdough's taken over my life in a huge way. I'm really talking about bread uh 60% of the time now. And it's it's become, it's become a huge huge factor.
[38:37] Travis Kelce, I mean and she's getting good with making all these different versions of it.
[38:42] Taylor Swift, Oh yeah.
[38:43] Travis Kelce, My favorite one was probably, I mean the regular sourdough is one of my favorites, but the blueberry.
[38:48] Taylor Swift, Yeah, we do there's a blueberry lemon. There's cinnamon swirl, cinnamon raisin. And this one I've been workshopping for the girls because they love everything rainbow. Funfetti sourdough.
[38:59] Jason Kelce, Oh my gosh. Does that blow their mind?
[39:01] Taylor Swift, Yes, it will. Because they love sprinkles like we put, you know, we put sprinkles in everything when we hang out.
[39:08] Jason Kelce, yeah.
[39:08] Taylor Swift, um, it's really uh, yeah.
[39:12] Travis Kelce, she's a loafer for life now. Yeah.
[39:13] Taylor Swift, It's gotten it's gotten pretty crazy over here. I'm just like always like baking bread and texting my friends and being like, "Can I send you some bread? I need some feedback. Do you like this one better than you liked the other one? I did the rise a little differently." I'm on like sourdough blogs.
[39:31] Jason Kelce, there's a whole, there's a whole community of us.
[39:35] Taylor Swift, and I didn't know it. Oh my gosh. The amount of people hoping that you're on their blog.
[39:41] Taylor Swift, Oh I'm on your blog. I'm on your blog, girl, I'm on your blog. Um, but it's like I just didn't know this.
[39:47] Taylor Swift, there's people like me out there. And this is where the internet is good. This is where the internet is a good place where you can curate a reality where like all I really use the internet for is sourdough and when Travis shows me videos of otters on his Instagram algorithm.
[40:04] Travis Kelce, I want a wild otter. So bad. I just want to like find these little creatures and be friends with them.
[40:11] Jason Kelce, But he wants wild one. Why why a wild one? Why wouldn't you just because aren't they all wild. Aren't they all wild?
[40:16] Travis Kelce, There's domestic. They're domesticated. no, there's domestic otters. He wants one specifically who's life he saved who knows that he saved his life.
[40:24] Jason Kelce, that's very noble. that feels a debt
[40:26] Taylor Swift, It's a really specific type of otter he's looking for.
[40:28] Travis Kelce, The the videos that I watch are somebody just in a canoe and he doesn't want to like go up to an otter and take it from its mother.
[40:34] Jason Kelce, No.
[40:35] Taylor Swift, He wants to see an otter and the otter's like my paws caught in a shell
[40:39] Travis Kelce, oh my god.
[40:39] Taylor Swift, And he's like, I got you. And then the otter's like, thank you forever with its little paws and then it brings me anchovies every couple months. and then it swims up and then it's and you're kayaking and it's like doing this to you.
[40:51] Travis Kelce, like that's what he wants. and I want it too, honestly. who doesn't
[40:55] Jason Kelce, Yeah I mean who doesn't? Yeah. right? yeah
[40:58] Jason Kelce, do otters eat bread? Can we get a a sourdough eating otter? That might be the perfect
[41:03] Taylor Swift, that's the combination. I don't know if they I don't know if they do.
[41:05] Jason Kelce, I don't know. Probably not.
[41:08] Taylor Swift, But yeah, we had discussed maybe like carrying around cans of sardines just in case we run into one.
[41:14] Jason Kelce, Nice.
[41:15] Taylor Swift, It's it's it's better in principle than it is in practice. easier to easier to conceptualize than to actually
[41:20] Travis Kelce, Sea otters are pretty easy to find. You just gotta go canoeing.
[41:22] Taylor Swift, which is also easier in principle than it is in practice.
[41:25] Jason Kelce, yeah
[41:26] Taylor Swift, for us in terms of just the weight balance on the water.
[41:28] Travis Kelce, I'm on the hunt. I'm on the hunt for a friend.
[41:31] Jason Kelce, All right.
[41:32] Taylor Swift, yeah stuff you didn't know you needed to know right Jason?
[41:35] Jason Kelce, I mean I love otters. I don't know who doesn't love watching otters.
[41:37] Travis Kelce, But this is what life after eras tour is though Jason. You gotta
[41:40] Taylor Swift, it's so precious
[41:41] Jason Kelce, Travis I am retired. I am all in on this. I want to bake. I just don't have the planning behind it. Taylor's a planner and she's going to have the sourdough alive. We're not going to keep a sourdough alive.
[41:51] Taylor Swift, I I've folded I've
[41:53] Travis Kelce, What is it? I've
[41:54] Taylor Swift, he's actually done it.
[41:55] Travis Kelce, I've made a loaf. He's had one of my loaves actually. He's done it he's done all of it.
[42:00] Jason Kelce, It was delicious.
[42:01] Taylor Swift, Like we've we've set it up where it's like I've got a station and he's got a station and he's done all of it.
[42:06] Jason Kelce, okay.
[42:06] Travis Kelce, So he's actually baked too.
[42:08] Travis Kelce, Yeah. I've stretched and folded before. Yeah. I've
[42:10] Jason Kelce, But there's just like something always slightly wrong with it.
[42:12] Travis Kelce, I've weighed I've weighed out all the flour. No, his was actually his rose higher than mine. His was more delicious than mine.
[42:17] Jason Kelce, it's it's also you know,
[42:19] Taylor Swift, No directions over here, Jason. I get into the whole you should said dough. uhm, No it's horrible. Um, uh it's a loaf story, baby just say yeast.
[42:31] Jason Kelce, just say yeast. Yeah,
[42:33] Travis Kelce, It's good, though. good twist.
[42:34] Taylor Swift, Uh, what's another one I'm doing to? what's one I was doing to dough? It's a love story. baby just say no. It's horrible.
[42:44] Taylor Swift, loving him was bread.
[42:47] Taylor Swift, It's bad.
[42:48] Travis Kelce, I love you. It wasn't on the tour.
[42:53] Jason Kelce, Tour. So I we do have this. I did fuck that up. 21 countries. Did you learn anything throughout, is there anything at the end of the tour when you were wrapping up that you wish you would have been doing the whole time? Is there anything you would do differently now that the entire tour is wrapped up?
[44:11] Taylor Swift, No. I, I I'm really glad that I didn't know it would have gone on as long as it did.
[44:16] Jason Kelce, yeah.
[44:17] Taylor Swift, Um, I'm I'm glad that I got to like actually be prepared for this tour the way that I was because, you know, in previous tours, I had noticed that I would get on the tour and I'd have to like get my stamina up through the tour and by the last quarter of the tour, I'd finally hit my stride stamina-wise and I'd be like, "oh I can do this easily every night."
[44:38] Jason Kelce, Yeah.
[44:39] Taylor Swift, I wanted to be at that point at the beginning of the eras tour. So that's why I did so much more training, so much more endurance training and and cardio and stuff that you know, doesn't come naturally because I'm not an athlete. So it's like that stuff I have to really force myself to do.
[44:54] Jason Kelce, Don't you say that. Don't you say that. I mean,
[44:56] Taylor Swift, it's how I feel and I don't even it's not like I say that in a disparaging way. I
[45:00] Jason Kelce, I don't care. I'm not I'm not an athlete and that's fine. Like I play instruments.
[45:11] Travis Kelce, She's just so interested in being an athlete.
[45:12] Taylor Swift, This is not
[45:12] Travis Kelce, I take it that way because we're undefeated on the beer pong table. Um I've seen you throw a football.
[45:17] Taylor Swift, No, that's not good and you know that's not good.
[45:19] Travis Kelce, It does. It does.
[45:21] Taylor Swift, No. You can
[45:22] Travis Kelce, spiral.
[45:23] Jason Kelce, Yes.
[45:24] Travis Kelce, You you got to
[45:24] Jason Kelce, got to be realistic about this because it's not there's no spiral.
[45:27] Taylor Swift, I don't think I've ever caught anything that's ever been thrown to me, near me, around me.
[45:32] Travis Kelce, I've seen it.
[45:35] Jason Kelce, that's true. Can you hit something with a stick? That's a telltale sign of an athlete. Could with a stick?
[45:41] Taylor Swift, I don't know Jason. I've never tried that. So it's like
[45:43] Travis Kelce, we gotta try this out now. We're going out back after this.
[45:46] Jason Kelce, Here's the thing right. My relationship with sports was like you know I grew up in Pennsylvania. I always heard my dad yelling at the screen watching Eagles games. That was always the sports sounds that I heard in my house. However, I was up in my room playing guitar, learning instruments, playing piano. Just I was focused on different things. I was like so laser focused on music and that's how I was in school. Like I I would go to sporting events so that I could sing the national anthem. Like everything was a means to an end to get me to get to do music.
[46:17] Taylor Swift, and I know every halftime show from the Super Bowls but I don't I didn't watch the sports.
[46:22] Travis Kelce, and watching the Eras tour and seeing that power skip, I knew you're an athlete from the from the from the power skip.
[46:29] Taylor Swift, that's you're telling lies. just looking like a giraffe that's limbs were put on all wrong.
[46:37] Travis Kelce, not everybody can everybody can skip, but not everybody can power skip in heels. That takes athleticism.
[46:41] Taylor Swift, Thank you. I appreciate that.
[46:43] Jason Kelce, What a unique compliment.
[46:45] Taylor Swift, Um, so yeah, I I I definitely became obsessed with sports when it came to him. I'm competitive on his behalf, but like if you and me are going to go against each other in something athletic, I'm going to let you win because to me like I don't see what the points even mean if I'm doing it. I'm a fan of athletics and the sports. If I'm doing the sports, I'm throwing like this cuz I don't, I don't really care if it goes where it's supposed to go. It doesn't bother me. and when I don't make the catch, I'm not embarrassed. It's fine.
[47:20] Travis Kelce, she's a good teammate so she'll she'll give effort if you're if it's teamed up, it's individual sports she's not going to care. but if she needs to be held accountable,
[47:26] Taylor Swift, if I'm on his team and we're playing beer pong or something, I'm really trying because this matters to him, right?
[47:33] Jason Kelce, you're on a team sport's girl. You're now you're an all in
[47:34] Taylor Swift, I'm a team sports gal. Put me, put me on an Olympic one person trying to do some stuff sport. I'm doing this.
[47:44] Jason Kelce, Yeah.
[47:45] Taylor Swift, I don't care if this happens.
[47:47] Travis Kelce, I'm doing this.
[47:48] Jason Kelce, Okay. I'm getting out of here.
[47:48] Taylor Swift, kneeling dough. I don't care. I care. This kneeling dough I care. This I don't care.
[47:56] Travis Kelce, this stretch and fold, stretch and fold.
[47:57] Taylor Swift, I don't care if this happens. It's not part of my metrics for my self worth.
[48:02] Jason Kelce, All right. that's probably very healthy to be honest with you.
[48:04] Taylor Swift, Hey, you know?
[48:08] Taylor Swift, As long as you're fine with this.
[48:09] Travis Kelce, No, I'm completely fine with you being an athlete. Yeah. I'm not an athlete and that's okay.
[48:13] Jason Kelce, I think you just missed the whole point of that.
[48:15] Taylor Swift, Yeah. He sees what he wants to see and it bodes well for me.
[48:21] Jason Kelce, All right.
[48:23] Jason Kelce, Do you have a favorite thing from the Eras tour?
[48:24] Taylor Swift, I have a lot of favorite things from the Eras tour. Um, I would look out and I would see a lot of bonding happening between generations of people.
[48:32] Jason Kelce, gosh, that's so true.
[48:33] Taylor Swift, It was really wonderful.
[48:35] Taylor Swift, It was like the most incredible feeling in the world because I can see all that.
[48:40] Travis Kelce, I've got lasik. I have incredible vision.
[48:42] Taylor Swift, Basically the eras tour, I think one of my favorite things was when the fans would come up with their own traditions, right?
[48:49] Travis Kelce, that's so cool.
[48:49] Taylor Swift, because I can I can plan a stage show that's like we know exactly what's happening when it's going to happen. It's very stage managed. It's a whole production, right? and I love to plan. But I also love surprises.
[49:02] Taylor Swift, like there's a time during the European like of the Eras tour. There's a song called Willow where we do a performance where we have these it's a very like witchy performance. We have these like light up orbs and we're in cloaks and it's all very woo.
[49:15] Jason Kelce, and the fans decided that they were going to bring their own light up orbs and by that I mean
[49:22] Taylor Swift, balloons that they would blow up in the audience like and then they would light their they would use their phone light behind it and create a light up orb.
[49:31] Jason Kelce, When I tell you I looked out
[49:34] Jason Kelce, or a glow stick. Whatever. Like they would figure out ways to
[49:37] Taylor Swift, illuminate them themselves and it was insane to look out and see spontaneously thousands of these orbs just go up and I and I just be like I I don't even know who organized this.
[49:52] Jason Kelce, yeah. Was there a group text? How did you guys even do this? It was so special.
[49:58] Taylor Swift, it felt like we were all
[49:59] Taylor Swift, it felt like we were all a team. That was my favorite.
