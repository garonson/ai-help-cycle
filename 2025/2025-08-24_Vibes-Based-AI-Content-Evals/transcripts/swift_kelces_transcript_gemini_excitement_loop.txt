[ 2m53s - 2m58s ] Taylor Swift: No, that was so good. Thank you. I tried to I tried Thank you for screaming for like 47 seconds for me. That was so nice.
[ 2m58s - 3m0s ] Jason Kelce: I'm shaking right now.
[ 3m0s - 3m2s ] Taylor Swift: No, you did a great job.
[ 3m2s - 3m3s ] Travis Kelce: Take a deep breath big guy.
[ 3m3s - 3m4s ] Jason Kelce: Did I get everything?
[ 3m4s - 3m12s ] Taylor Swift: That was such an amazing intro and also just like thanks for wearing the merch. That goes a long way.
[ 3m12s - 3m18s ] Taylor Swift: Just like immediately makes me feel comfortable just looking deeply into my own eyes.
[ 3m18s - 3m22s ] Jason Kelce: Okay, all right. That's what I was going for.
[ 3m22s - 3m23s ] Travis Kelce: It's a good t-shirt.
[ 3m23s - 3m25s ] Taylor Swift: Well, thanks for having me. This is my first podcast.
[ 3m25s - 3m28s ] Jason Kelce: This is amazing. Thank you for coming on.
[ 3m28s - 3m33s ] Taylor Swift: I just I was waiting for you guys to invite me. This is my favorite podcast.
[ 3m33s - 3m42s ] Jason Kelce: So we've already been over this. You're a big fan of the show, you're a 92 percenter. What are your favorite segments that you hear Travis and I go into on a routine basis?
[ 3m42s - 4m6s ] Taylor Swift: I like New News just because of the screaming, like I hear him screaming new news from across the house constantly. It's like my favorite part like he'll be like, new news, new news. And I'm in the kitchen be like, new news. Um so I love that because of just the bellowing of it like I love um no dumb questions.
[ 4m6s - 4m11s ] Taylor Swift: I really like it when you give people advice. It's my it's kind of my personal favorite.
[ 4m11s - 4m27s ] Taylor Swift: I mean I think that like you guys give such male-centric advice. It's which which I think is just like just dudes who don't want drama. Dudes who are trying to avoid the mess. Or but sometimes you're going to like do a bit and say the messiest thing that they could do, which is funny too.
[ 4m27s - 4m35s ] Jason Kelce: So, we're going to ask a question everybody watching the show is currently asking. Why are you coming on the show?
[ 4m35s - 4m47s ] Taylor Swift: This podcast has done a lot for me. Um, I owe a lot to this podcast. This podcast got me a boyfriend. Um, ever since Travis decided to use it as his personal dating app about two years ago.
[ 4m47s - 4m50s ] Travis Kelce: It worked pretty good. Yeah. Hey,
[ 4m50s - 4m51s ] Jason Kelce: was his friendship bracelets that good?
[ 4m51s - 4m53s ] Travis Kelce: Yeah, they didn't leave the stadium because I was butt hurt, Jason.
[ 4m53s - 5s14s ] Taylor Swift: He was he threw a tantrum. He threw a man tantrum. It's so funny. It's like old. My plan is ruined. She loves me. She loves me not. She loves me. She loves me not. And she just just wild. She hates me. Like it was such a wild romantic gesture to just be like
[ 5s14s - 5s24s ] Taylor Swift: I want to date you like on. I don't know. It was at first when I looked at it, I was like, this dude is That's what it That's what it does when you're on the stage and you perform in arrow head. That's what it does.
[ 5s24s - 5s35s ] Taylor Swift: This dude didn't get a meet and greet, he's making it everyone's problem. That's what I thought at first and then I was like you come to Arrow head, I get to meet you.
[ 5s35s - 5s40s ] Travis Kelce: That's the perk of playing for the Chiefs. You realize he didn't even reach out to our management.
[ 5s40s - 6s10s ] Taylor Swift: I was like when this podcast came out, I was like, did he ever reach out to be like in the tents or did we know he was in the building? He came with Pat and he thought that cuz he knows the elevator lady that he could talk to her about just getting down to my dressing room. That's how it works. You just go. I got denied. That's how it works in 1973 when the elevator was invented. Yeah, but yeah, but he but he really just was like, I know a guy.
[ 6s10s - 6s30s ] Taylor Swift: I can figure this out. But um I actually when I thought about it, I was like, actually we live in a day and age where like I'm not a very I'm not an online person at all. I'm not like on social media like that. and like I'm genuinely terrified to open my DMs. It's just like it's just like there's smoke coming out of my DM.
[ 6s30s - 6s31s ] Travis Kelce: Are you not entertained?
[ 6s31s - 6s32s ] Jason Kelce: No.
[ 6s32s - 6s44s ] Taylor Swift: So this kind of felt more like I was in an 80s John Hughes movie and he was just like standing outside of my window with a boom box just being like, I want to date you.
[ 6s44s - 6s45s ] Travis Kelce: Yeah.
[ 6s45s - 6s50s ] Taylor Swift: Do you want to go on a date with me? I made you a friendship brace, so do you want to date me?
[ 6s50s - 6s52s ] Travis Kelce: Just come outside and meet me. Just meet me once.
[ 6s52s - 7s11s ] Taylor Swift: Give me a chance. So if this guy isn't crazy which is a big if this is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager.
[ 7s11s - 7s13s ] Jason Kelce: I I feel that.
[ 7s13s - 7s16s ] Taylor Swift: And I was sitting there at the tour listening to every single one of the songs like she, I know she wants me to do this.
[ 7s16s - 7s18s ] Travis Kelce: We have one IP address from one iPhone that continuously has listened to these songs.
[ 7s18s - 7s20s ] Taylor Swift: It's fantastic. Thank you so much.
[ 7s20s - 7s28s ] Jason Kelce: Did you have a favorite album that you re-recorded that like, are there different eras that you liked recording more rerecording.
[ 7s28s - 7s34s ] Travis Kelce: I will say this, there's a few good playlists out there that have a mixture of them all. You've been streaming?
[ 7s34s - 7s44s ] Taylor Swift: I really liked them all, but I think Red was very special. There were songs that I called from the vault songs. And there was one which I think is maybe my favorite song I've ever written called all too well the 10-minute version where I unearthed
[ 7s44s - 7s51s ] Taylor Swift: there were there were originally so many more verses in that song than ended up being on the on the album that I had put out when I originally put out Red.
[ 7s51s - 7s58s ] Taylor Swift: I made the um the glorious fortuitous mistake of saying that to my fans in an interview.
[ 7s58s - 8s2s ] Jason Kelce: You know what those words mean. you're so handsome.
[ 8s2s - 8s6s ] Taylor Swift: So um basically uh I
[ 8s6s - 8s14s ] Taylor Swift: said that in an interview to my fans and they just like hung on to it. They were like where's the 10-minute version? Give us the 10-minute version. Yeah. And
[ 8s14s - 8s24s ] Taylor Swift: when it came time to doing Taylor's version and re-recording the album, I went back in, found the verses, um restructured the song to the way that it pretty much was when I had originally written it.
[ 8s24s - 8s31s ] Taylor Swift: Put them back in. And that song is one of my favorite things I've ever done and it was on the tour
[ 8s31s - 8s34s ] Jason Kelce: You want to know what's iconic part of your your that tour.
[ 8s34s - 8s44s ] Taylor Swift: It it was so fun and so like yeah, it really did make me fall back in love with that album specifically. I have a song with Phoebe Bridgers that I really love on that from the vault.
[ 8s44s - 8s50s ] Taylor Swift: Chris Stapleton was a part of it as well. And I just I think that one
[ 8s50s - 9s12s ] Taylor Swift: I've always loved Fearless in 1989 in a very pure way, but Red I've kind of gone back and forth over the years and been like, you know, like that re-recording it made me just be like, ah, God, I love that album. I have no no complicated feelings about it.
[ 9s12s - 9s20s ] Taylor Swift: I wouldn't have done anything different. Maybe except include the original versus the first time. Well, you you told a story with the second time you released this album, right? And the fans got behind that narrative and they're like
[ 9s20s - 9s24s ] Travis Kelce: And by the way Screw the first album. We're we're rolling with the re-recorded album because we're supporting the artists.
[ 9s24s - 9s28s ] Taylor Swift: Yeah They were like we ride at dawn. Like and it was an it was amazing because
[ 9s28s - 9s51s ] Taylor Swift: they're the reason why the re records worked out. They're the reason I was able to purchase my music back because they came to the A tour. Um and basically they're the reason why any of this worked out and I also want to note that like the other people who are like we ride at dawn
[ 9s51s - 10s7s ] Taylor Swift: my live band they played on all the re records. It's like you want to know why they sound so perfect on the A tour. They played on all those records. Like they're session musicians too.
[ 10s7s - 10s17s ] Taylor Swift: And that's how good they are. And I'm I'm so impressed just by their ability and their dexterity as musicians to be able to do that.
[ 10s17s - 10s20s ] Travis Kelce: So, how does music ownership, this is so crazy to me.
[ 10s20s - 10s23s ] Taylor Swift: So there's two main categories that we're talking about here.
[ 10s23s - 10s33s ] Taylor Swift: So, master recordings is the actual recording. It's the actual vocal band production, mixing, mastering, that actual thing.
[ 10s33s - 10s36s ] Jason Kelce: Mine also included my album artwork, my music videos,
[ 10s36s - 10s45s ] Taylor Swift: everything that went along with any era of music that I had done for my first six albums. And so.
[ 10s45s - 10s50s ] Taylor Swift: Then there's also the then there's another category which is publishing. I own my publishing.
[ 10s50s - 11s15s ] Taylor Swift: Which is why, you know, I have control over you know, if my song is used in a film and and I wanted them to use Taylor's version instead of the original version, I the songwriter can decide that. Yeah. So and it's like I basically I I've always been very lucky because my publishing was protected.
[ 11s15s - 11s32s ] Jason Kelce: You being the song writer, being the singer, owning no publishing rights, being able to re-record songs, that gave you leverage and able to make this move, right?
[ 11s32s - 11s34s ] Taylor Swift: Yes. Yeah.
[ 11s34s - 11s35s ] Jason Kelce: Yes.
[ 11s35s - 11s51s ] Travis Kelce: So and also in my contract, they didn't put a clause in that said I couldn't re-record because nobody was doing it and nobody thought that was a good idea. Right. And also like who would be that stubborn? Like who would be
[ 11s1s - 11s56s ] Taylor Swift: that petty that they would record every single thing all over again.
[ 11s2s - 11s58s ] Travis Kelce: It's so bad ass get over here. What was your favorite one to re record.
[ 11s8s - 12s0s ] Jason Kelce: No not just that. Hold on though, not just that.
[ 12s0s - 12s4s ] Jason Kelce: Who has a fan base that's going to listen to the same album twice in a row? It's a good point Jason. It's an a good point. You know what it is?
[ 12s4s - 12s9s ] Jason Kelce: you had this die hard community that you already built.
[ 12s9s - 12s24s ] Taylor Swift: The fans, you ride it Dawn. They're the reason why any of this has happened, and also I want to note that like the other people who are like, we ride at dawn. My live band, they played on all the records. Like you want to know why they sound so perfect on the tour. They played on all those records. Like they're session musicians too.
[ 12s4s - 12s25s ] Travis Kelce: You told a story with the second time you released this album, right? And the fans got behind that narrative. And I was on the A's tour.
[ 12s5s - 12s44s ] Taylor Swift: I'm watching people just like cathartically scream this song to the point where I'm like, do you need do you need to go to the hospital? Like, it was so passionate the fan response to that song at the A tour and I remember thinking so many times like, what if this never happened? Like, what if I never had the record. it's one of the most iconic parts of your of that tour. It it was so fun and so like yeah, it really did make me fall back in love with that album specifically.
[ 12s4s - 12s47s ] Jason Kelce: And they're like screw the first album. We're rolling with the re-recorded album because we're supporting the artist, right?
[ 12s7s - 13s8s ] Taylor Swift: I have a song with Phoebe Bridgers that I really love on that from the vault. Chris Stapleton was a part of it as well. And I just, I think that one, I've always loved Fearless in 1989 in a very pure way, but Red, I've kind of gone back and forth over the years and been like, you know, like that re-recording it made me just be like, ah, God, I love that album. I have no no complicated feelings about it. I wouldn't have done anything different. Maybe except I would have include the original verses the first time.
[ 13s8s - 13s30s ] Taylor Swift: Basically, then you have the the master recordings side of things. Now, this is a discussion that was not really brought up among the artist communities, especially not with fans. This was all kind of industry-centric and kind of boring contract stuff that like fans were not speaking about.
[ 13s0s - 13s32s ] Jason Kelce: So how how does ownership of music even work? Like when you recorded these songs when you were 16, right? Is that like the singer gets a certain portion, the the artist gets or the songwriter gets a certain portion and then the publishing company gets a certain portion?
[ 13s2s - 13s41s ] Travis Kelce: Can you dump it down to us? 99%. you're so good. I didn't even know what you just asked. Go ahead. The greatest songwriter of all time. Says her boyfriend. Yes. Yeah, it's a huge thing.
[ 13s1s - 13s43s ] Taylor Swift: and so one thing that I think is really great that has come about because of this is that I have so many new artists come up to me now and say, hey, I didn't even know this was a thing. And when I went to go and negotiate for my record deal, I negotiated to have my masters revert back to me after a certain amount of years.
[ 13s3s - 13s48s ] Jason Kelce: Oh, wow. Yeah. or that I own them outright.
[ 13s8s - 13s58s ] Taylor Swift: And it's not for everyone. Not everyone cares about this. Artist to artist, artists have different priorities. Some artists sell off all their masters because everyone's allowed to have their own priorities. What I wanted though is that
[ 13s8s - 14s2s ] Jason Kelce: You're more aware than I think probably most artists are. That's crazy.
[ 14s2s - 14s18s ] Taylor Swift: if I were to put the information out about what I went through, at least it gets artists talking about this to decide whether this is a priority for them because you can't know if it's a priority for you unless you know what has come before you and what has happened and so that's why
[ 14s8s - 14s20s ] Travis Kelce: I know who she is. You know what I'm saying. I'm telling you. And this is where they missed it.
[ 14s0s - 14s23s ] Jason Kelce: She's a smart woman in the world. Says her boyfriend, smartest woman in the world. you're making this die hard community that you already built.
[ 14s3s - 14s24s ] Travis Kelce: I listen to the I'll listen to the fear of 1989 I'll listen to that one too.
[ 14s4s - 14s31s ] Taylor Swift: I had to re record my music. I didn't have to re record the music videos and everything. I do love every era, but I definitely feel a special connection to what it's about and the memories and the fans being as crazy as they are.
[ 14s1s - 14s36s ] Jason Kelce: Do you think it was easier for you to do one because you're I mean, just you talking about this, you're so aware of the business side of this in the legal ramifications.
[ 14s6s - 14s49s ] Taylor Swift: But I'm going to have so many more re records. I'm going to be doing one more re record and I really enjoyed every single second of making all of these re records. But I will say that the original songs I put on the re records, like the from the Vault songs, the songs I didn't get on the album, those are my favorites because it's like a time capsule of like these songs that I was so attached to and so obsessed with and so excited about.
[ 14s9s - 15s6s ] Taylor Swift: But my record label was like, no, this is not a hit. We're not putting this on the album. And like, sometimes that's right. Sometimes that's wrong. You know? And it's so much fun to just like give people like the the full picture, the full story of what it was like to make these albums and what the original track list was supposed to be before people had opinions.
[ 15s6s - 15s32s ] Taylor Swift: It's like I have the original track list of all of the songs from all of the albums and then I have a whole bunch of extra songs that I wrote and loved and adored and had a whole plan for and then the record label was like, let's take these three off and put these other three on. And so I'm like, oh my god, they're like my children. You're like, which one am I gonna choose? And so it's just really cool to be able to kind of give the fans the whole story.
[ 15s2s - 15s33s ] Jason Kelce: So you're saying every album that you've ever done had other songs that you thought about putting on there? Yeah. So you have a vault of songs that you just are like, this is the first time you've released them?
[ 15s3s - 15s52s ] Taylor Swift: Yes, and I had like 50 songs for Fearless and I had like 40 songs for Speak Now and I had like 30 something songs for Red and like I just have to like pick 13 to 15. And it's like and these were songs that I like I I adored these songs and I had to make these really difficult choices and so it was such a like a glorious thing to be able to put those songs out.
[ 15s2s - 15s55s ] Travis Kelce: I thought that was one of the coolest things about the records. It wasn't just the fact that it was yours, it was the fact that you threw on some like, like Jason just said, some vaulted songs that you just couldn't put on there, I think the first time. I mean I don't know the exact story.
[ 15s5s - 16s3s ] Taylor Swift: Every single one of them has at least eight vault songs. And so I think like I was thinking that was really cool. And like what a fun thing for the fans to look forward to of like I get to hear these songs for the first time.
[ 16s3s - 16s16s ] Taylor Swift: It's kind of like I get to have like a new album release with an old album at the same time. And I think that's why they did so well. I think that's why they were so exciting because like the fans were like, oh my gosh, I get to listen to this album again, but also I get to hear these new songs.
[ 16s6s - 16s21s ] Travis Kelce: So you got the original and then you get that vault and then you get Taylor's version which is just better produced. Like the production on it's just unreal. I don't know the I don't know the exact but it's just cleaner. It's just a it's a better feel to the to the actual like the sound of it, the music itself.
[ 16s1s - 16s32s ] Jason Kelce: I didn't know there were new songs on there. I'm such an idiot. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I feel bad now. Like a die hard 92%. I'm supposed to know these things. My god. How how dare I not know that there are new songs on there?
[ 16s2s - 16s45s ] Taylor Swift: Jason, they are called from the vault songs. And they are literally the best thing ever. I love them so much. I love the fact that like I can release them now. They have such special like features on them. I have a feature with Florence and the Machine on the new on the Speak Now re record. And I have Chris Stapleton, I have Phoebe Bridgers, I have all these artists that like are my friends and are amazing.
[ 16s5s - 16s51s ] Jason Kelce: Do you ask these guys if they're like, hey, I got these songs I've had in the vault. Do you want to do a song together?
[ 16s1s - 17s8s ] Taylor Swift: So I will like I I will call them and I'll be like, hey, I'm re recording this album and I think you would be amazing on this song. And like, so then they'll come in and they'll record and like it's just it's just such a cool process to revisit these albums.
[ 17s8s - 17s15s ] Taylor Swift: but it's also like a little bit of a time machine because you're going back to when you were 16 and you're like, oh my god, I was so dramatic. And then you're going back to when you're 18 and you're like, oh my god, I was so dramatic.
[ 17s5s - 17s23s ] Jason Kelce: And what do you think of Travis when he does the do you look back at that and be like, oh, he's so dramatic? When he's doing the, like, he's on the ground. Like, oh my God. Oh my God. He's so dramatic.
[ 17s3s - 17s40s ] Taylor Swift: I just think it's funny. I think that he is such a such a like a character. I mean, he is, you've seen him. He is such a character. And I think that it's so funny to watch him get all fired up and I'm like, oh my god. Like, that's my boyfriend. I'm so proud of him. And like, he is just so passionate about what he does and I think it's so cool. I love it.
[ 17s0s - 17s47s ] Travis Kelce: I mean I'm just trying to get some some calls thrown my way. I mean sometimes you just got to flop. I mean that's the nature of the game. You're not trying to flop. I mean you are trying to flop. You're trying to sell it a little bit but it's like hey you got to try and do something to get the to get the ref to throw a flag. I mean it's football.
[ 17s7s - 18s3s ] Taylor Swift: it's not, I don't know, it's just funny to watch you get all fired up and I'm like, oh my God, like, that's my boyfriend. I'm so proud of him. And like, he is just so passionate about what he does and I think it's so cool. I love it. It's funny because I think that like, I've had to explain to so many of my friends like what is happening and why is he screaming and what does that mean and what are the stakes and everything. And it's like I've learned so much about football.
[ 17s7s - 18s6s ] Jason Kelce: Yeah. Has this been weird to go into this, this world of football? Cause I mean, I would assume you've, maybe you were into it before, I don't know, but to, to go into this whole world, and now you have like, I don't know, half the league's fans, like, following you, and like, you have all these like, what is, what has that been like?
[ 18s6s - 18s30s ] Taylor Swift: It's been wild. I mean, it's been so much fun. I've had such a blast. I mean, I have been, I have gone to more football games this season than I have in my entire life. And I have loved every second of it. I love the fact that it is a community. I love the fact that it is, it's like, it's such a sport. It's so strategic. And it's so like, it's so fun to watch. And I've gotten to learn so much about it.
[ 18s0s - 18s33s ] Travis Kelce: And she's a smart one. So she's learning fast. I mean, I tell her, I'm like, hey, that's a, that's a cover too. She's like, I know what a cover too is. I'm like, all right. I'm like, hey, we're in a, we're in a goal line situation. She's like, I know we're in a goal line situation. I'm like, all right. I mean, you get it.
[ 18s3s - 18s50s ] Jason Kelce: Well, that's good. I'm glad that you're enjoying it. I'm glad that you're, you know, coming out and supporting Travis. I mean, it's been, it's been fun for, for me, for Kylie, for our family to get to know you. And, you know, we, we've had a blast. We've, we've had so much fun with you.

I've gotten to hang out with Kylie. I've gotten to hang out with you, Jason. I've gotten to hang out with Donna. And it's been so much fun. And I've loved it so much. And it's been so much fun to get to know your whole family.
[ 18s1s - 19s24s ] Jason Kelce: Well, and then on top of that, you know, we have, we have a little something for you because, you know, we, we were thinking about what we could possibly get you that you don't already have. And we know that you're a big collector. We know that you love collecting things. And so, we, we have a couple of things for you. We have a, a New Heights vinyl. And we have a New Heights Super Bowl ring. So, we, we have, we have a couple of things for you to add to your collection. And, you know, we, we hope you enjoy them. And we hope that, you know, you'll, you'll think of us when you, when you look at them. And, you know, we, we love you. We're so happy for you guys. And we're excited to see where it goes.
[ 19s4s - 19s26s ] Taylor Swift: Oh my god, you guys. Oh my god. This is the sweetest thing. Oh my god. I'm going to cry. Oh my god. This is so sweet. I love this so much. Thank you guys so much.
